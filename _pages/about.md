I'm a Ph.D. student from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) working with Prof. [Keping Qiu](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/People/Professor/20200707/i113710.html). I'm interested in using high-resolution milimeter/submilimeter interferometers like [SMA](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/), [NOEMA](https://iram-institute.org/science-portal/noema/) and [ALMA](https://almascience.nrao.edu/) to investigate the dynamics and evolution of circumstellar disks around massive protostars. I'm also interested in using polarimeter to study the role of magnetic fields in star formation processes in our Galaxy.
