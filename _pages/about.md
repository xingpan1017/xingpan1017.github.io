I'm a Ph.D. student from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) working with Prof. [Keping Qiu](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/People/Professor/20200707/i113710.html) and Dr. [Qizhou Zhang](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/qizhou-zhang) from [CfA](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/). Currently, I'm interested in using high-resolution milimeter/submilimeter interferometers like [SMA](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/), [NOEMA](https://iram-institute.org/science-portal/noema/) and [ALMA](https://almascience.nrao.edu/) to explore the dynamics and evolution of circumstellar disks around massive protostars. I'm also interested in using polarimeter to study the role of magnetic fields in star formation processes in our Galaxy.
